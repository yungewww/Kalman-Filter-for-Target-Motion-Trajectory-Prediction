### Kalman-Filter-for-Target-Motion-Trajectory-Prediction

Using the VisDrone dataset provided by Nanjing University, I finetuned YOLOv8 for improved tracking of small objects. This model is then applied to remote sensing videos, where Kalman filters are employed to track both individual and multiple objects, accurately predicting their motion trajectories.
